\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%There are many workflow systems
Software that supports people working together is present in most workplaces nowadays.
Its aim is to automate business and workflow processes, in order to simplify processes, to improve service or to contain cost.
In settings like hospitals, first responders and military operations, these systems could even prevent the loss of lives.

%they are a problem because

Automation and digitalisation of workflows and business processes comes at a cost.
Using them requires workers to undergo training, and often relies on their experience and expertise~\cite{}\todo{cite}.

%our approach overcomes this because
To overcome these drawbacks, we propose to integrate a next step hint assistive system into the workflow software.
By combining previous research on symbolic execution for Task Oriented Programming~\cite{Naus2019} and end-user feedback systems for rule based problems~\cite{DBLP:conf/sfp/NausJ16},
we were able to develop a next step hint end-user feedback system for the Task Oriented Programming langugage \TOPHAT~\cite{Steenvoorden2019}.
Our solution, which we call Assistive \TOPHAT, generates next step hints from existing code, and does not require extra work by the programmer.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes the following contributions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We present an end user next step feedback system for \TOPHAT.
  \item We prove soundness and completeness of next step hints generated by this system.
  \item We present an implementation of the user feedback system in Haskell.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Structure}

\cref{sec:tophat} first introduces the Task-Oriented Programming (\TOP) paradigm and the Task-Oriented Programming language \TOPHAT.
\cref{sec:examples} lists three example programs to illustrate \TOPHAT work.
In \cref{sec:symbolic}, symbolic execution for \TOPHAT is briefly introduced.
\cref{sec:assistive} follows with a description of assistive \TOPHAT.
In \cref{sec:properties} soundness and completeness of the assistive system are shown.
An implementation of the system in Haskell is described in \cref{sec:implementation}.
\cref{sec:relatedwork} gives an overview of related work, and finally \cref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
