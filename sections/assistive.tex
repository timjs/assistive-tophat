\section{Generating next step hints}
\label{sec:assistive}

This section introduces our \ASTOPHAT system.
%What do we wanna do?
The aim of \ASTOPHAT is to automatically provide next step hints.
When users follow these hints, they can be sure that they will reach the goal they described beforehand.
Users can, however, still decide to deviate from the given hints.

During the execution of \TOPHAT programs, users are presented with input fields, choices and continue buttons.
The way in which tasks progress and the resulting task value depend on these inputs.
At any point during execution, we would like to present users with all possible inputs that leads users to the goal they have selected.
These inputs are either concrete actions, like continue, pick the left task, pick the right task;
or a restricted set of values to be entered into an editor.
This set is restricted, since concrete values potentially influence the flow of the program.
To give a concrete example, the user should enter an integer, but this integer must be larger than zero to reach the end goal.

To come to these concrete actions and restricted values, we make use of symbolic execution.
In the next two sections, we briefly describe how symbolic execution for \TOPHAT works
and recap its symbolic semantics presented in earlier work~\cite{Naus2019}.
Thereafter, we show how to turn symbolic execution results into next step hints.
In \cref{sub:assistive-tax,sub:assistive-dining}, we study what these automatically generated hints look like for the examples from \cref{sec:examples}.

%% Our examples work in implementation
All examples have been tested in our implementation.
%% We have an implementation
We added \ASTOPHAT to our existing implementation of \STOPHAT, which is written in Haskell.\footnote{https://github.com/timjs/symbolic-tophat-haskell}
It uses the \ZTHREE \SMT solver under the hood.
%% It works like this
By defining the formal hints function directly on top of the symbolic execution semantics, % in \cref{fig:hints},
we can leverage the already existing symbolic execution for \STOPHAT in the practical implementation.


\subsection{Symbolic execution}
\label{sub:symbolic-execution}

%%TS: dubbel op
% Our goal is to provide end users with next step hints in such a way that, whey they follow up those hints, they will reach a specified goal.
% To check if this goal is achievable, we make use of symbolic execution.
A symbolic execution semantics~\cite{King1975,Boyer1975} aims to execute a program without knowing its input.
Instead, symbols are fed into the program.
During evaluation, the influence of values is recorded in the path condition.
The symbolic results together with the path conditions can be used to prove properties of the program.

\begin{TASK}[
    float=ht,
    % numbers=right,
    caption={Ordering of tuple elements.},
    captionpos=b,
    label=lst:ordering]
  enter Int <&> enter Int >>= \<<x,y>>. if x > y then edit <<y, x>> else edit <<x, y>>
\end{TASK}

Consider the tiny example in \cref{lst:ordering}.
This program asks for two integer values.
After users entered this information, the step makes sure the result will be an editor containing a pair,
where the second element is larger then the first.
When we run this program symbolically, we have to create fresh symbols for both editors, say $s_0$ and $s_1$ respectively.
Continuing normalisation, there are two possible outcomes, namely
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\tuple{s_1,s_0}$, provided that the path condition $\phi_1 = s_0 > s_1 = s_1 < s_0$ holds; or
  \item $\tuple{s_0,s_1}$, with path condition $\phi_2 = \lnot (s_0 > s_1) = s_0 \leq s_1$.
\end{itemize}

Now, the property that we want to prove for this program is that no matter what the input is, the second element should always be larger than the first.
We write this goal property as $\psi(\<a, b\>)= a \leq b$.
Looking at the two symbolic runs, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are satisfiable, written $\Sat(\phi_1)$ and $\Sat(\phi_2)$, and conform to the goal property $\psi$.
Therefore, we can conclude that the goal property holds.
%
% Of course this is a trivial example, one can conclude or even prove that the property holds without symbolic execution.
% \cref{sec:assistivedining,sec:assistivetax} illustrates this by applying symbolic execution to larger examples.
When applying this technique to larger programs, it is a powerful tool to show that a program behaves as expected.
\todo{Describe pruning of branches which do not satisfy.}


\subsection{Symbolic semantics}
\label{sub:symbolic-semantics}

To support symbolic execution in \TOPHAT, we extend our host language with symbols.
Also, we need to modify the semantics described in \cref{sub:semantics}, to accommodate symbolic execution.
The observation functions from \cref{sub:observations} are extended in a similar way.
These new semantic relations operate on expressions which may contain symbols.
Instead of stepping to one result, they lead to a set of possible results, accompanied with a path condition $\phi$.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \caption{}
  \label{tab:semantic-relations}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l@{\Quad}L@{\Quad}L}
    \toprule
                  & \text{Concrete} & \text{Symbolic} \\
    \midrule
    Expressions   & e               & \tilde{e} \\
    Tasks         & t               & \tilde{t} \\
    States        & \sigma          & \tilde{\sigma} \\

    Interacting   & \RelationI      & \RelationSI \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We denote entities containing symbols with an additional tilde,
and symbolic semantic relations with squiggly arrows instead of straight ones.
So $\tilde{t}$, $\tilde{\sigma}$, and $\simi$ are respectively tasks, states, and inputs containing symbols.
\Cref{tab:semantic-relations} gives an overview of entities in the concrete world,
and their symbolic counterparts.
\todo{Caption.}
%
Note that concrete expressions are a subset of symbolic expressions.
Therefore, symbolic semantic relations can be applied on concrete expressions,
as well as on symbolic expressions.

The symbolic interaction semantics ($\siminteract$) results in just one symbolic input.
In other words, it just looks ahead one symbolic interaction.
To be able to reason about an end goal after multiple symbolic interactions,
we introduce the notion of \emph{simulation}.
Informally, simulation performs multiple symbolic interactions after each other,
till the moment the rewritten task has an observable value.
I.e. if $n$ is the number of interactions needed to be done,
$\Value(t_i', \sigma_i')$ has a result for $i = n$ but is undefined for all $i < n$.
Next to that, we want to permit only viable executions.
This is enforced by validating the satisfiability ($\Sat$) of all path condition together.
More formally, simulating a task for multiple user inputs is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}[Simulation]
  Let $t$ and $\sigma$ be a concrete task and concrete state.
  We define the simulation relation
  \begin{equation*}
    t,\sigma \simulate \overline{\tilde{v},\tilde{I},\Phi}
  \end{equation*}
  to be the set of results after performing symbolic interaction $n$ times:
  \begin{equation*}
      t,\sigma
        \siminteract \tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\simi_1,\phi_1
        \siminteract \cdots
        \siminteract \tilde{t}_n,\tilde{\sigma}_n,\simi_n,\phi_n
  \end{equation*}
  where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the $n$th task has a value: $\Value(\tilde{t}_n,\tilde{\sigma}_n) = \tilde{v}$;
    \item all tasks before do not have a value: $\Value(\tilde{t}_{i<n},\tilde{\sigma}_{i<n}) = \bot$;
    \item $\tilde{I} = \simi_1 \cdots \simi_n$ is the concatenation of all symbolic inputs generated along the way;
    \item $\Phi = \phi_1 \land \cdots \land \phi_n$, is the conjunction of all path conditions encountered.
  \end{itemize}
  Furthermore we require that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the resulting predicate is satisfiable: $\Sat(\Phi)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The simulation definition used in this paper differs from the one in previous work~\cite{Naus2019}.
Previously, infinite symbolic executions were filtered out by allowing two steps look-ahead in case of idempotent executions.
The definition above only allows finite executions by definition.

\subsection{Next step hints observation}
\label{sub:hints}

%How do we do this?

In order to calculate next step hints, first a goal must be formulated.
Since we are concerned with the resulting task value, the goal must be a predicate over the resulting value.
A task $\tilde{t}$ is considered done, as soon as it has an observable value $\tilde{v}$.

\begin{figure}
  \usemacro{O-Hints}
  \caption{Definition of next step hint function.}
  \label{fig:hints}
\end{figure}


Hints are calculated by means of the $\Hints$ function listed in \cref{fig:hints}.
As input it receives the task $t$ and state $\sigma$, together with the goal predicate $g$.
First, the simulate function is called on the task and input.
We only want to use the symbolic executions that satisfy the goal condition.
Executions that satisfy the goal $g(\tilde{v})$ are selected.
Since $\tilde{v}$ could contain symbols, it might be the case that $g(\tilde{v})$ is symbolic.
Therefore, we also require that the conjunction with the path condition $\Phi$ is satisfiable ($\Sat(\Phi\land g(\tilde{v}))$).

From the executions that fulfil this requirement, we return the first symbolic input $\tilde{i}$ from the complete list of inputs $\tilde{i}::\tilde{I}$,
together with the full condition that must hold ($\Sat(\Phi\land g(\tilde{v}))$).
The resulting set contains pairs of symbolic input guarded by a condition.

\cref{sub:assistive-tax} demonstrates on the basis of the tax example listed in \cref{sec:tax} how the results of the symbolic execution are used to construct automatic next step hints.
\cref{sub:assistive-dining} shows how hints can be generated during the execution of the example \TOPHAT program listed in \cref{sec:dining}.
Then in \cref{sec:implementation}, our implementation of \ASTOPHAT is presented.


\subsection{Tax subsidy request}
\label{sub:assistive-tax}

%recall
\cref{sec:tax} lists an example program in \TOPHAT for applying for a solar panel tax refund.
The user enters the invoice date and invoice amount, the installation company confirms, and finally the tax officer either approves or denies the request.

In this section, we will demonstrate what symbolic execution looks like for this example, and how we generate next step hints from the symbolic execution results.
First, we call the simulate function $\simulate$ on the program, with an empty state.
The resulting set of symbolic executions is listed in \cref{table:tax}.

Each line represents one symbolic execution.
In the first column, the resulting symbolic value $\tilde{v}$ is listed.
The second column lists the symbolic input $\tilde{I}$ that was produced to arrive at that value, followed by the path condition $\Phi$.
The symbolic values that are produced are $s_i$ for the invoice date and $s_a$ for the invoice amount.

The definition of $\Hints$ describes how these results should be used in order to calculate next step hints.
First of all, we need a goal $g$ to select the symbolic runs that we are interested in.
The most straight forward goal would be that we want to end up in a situation where we get a subsidy amount larger than zero.
This goal can be formulated as $\lambda \tuple{v,\_,\_,\_,\_}\rightarrow v>0$.

The first six symbolic runs listed in \cref{table:tax} fulfil the goal condition.
From those runs, we then take the first symbolic input, together with the path condition, in conjunction with the path condition applied to the goal.

After removing duplicates and redundant information, the result of $\Hints$ is as follows.

\begin{align*}
  \tuple{&\First \First s_{\id{a}},  &&(\min\ 600\ (s_{\id{a}}/10)) > 0} &\\
  \tuple{&\First \Second s_{\id{i}}, &&(\Today-s_{\id{i}}) < \OneYear} &\\
  \tuple{&\Second \First,            &&\True} &

%recall
Recall the example program Dining Computer Scientists from \cref{sec:dining}.
Three computer scientist sit at a table and have to coordinate in order to eat their meals.

%what hints do we want to give?
We want to calculate all possible next steps that lead to the goal.
The goal in this example is for all computer scientists to finish their meal.

%write the goal
In terms of the resulting task value, this means that we want to arrive at the value "Full bellies".
Witten as a predicate, we get $g=\lambda v\rightarrow v = "\text{Full bellies}"$.

%what does the result of H look like?
Let us assume that both Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace have already picked up the forks to their left (fork1 and fork2 respectively).
We then find ourselves in the following situation.

Calling $\Hints(t,\sigma,g)$ will result in just one hint, namely $\tuple{\Second\Second\Continue,\True}$.

This means that the only step towards the goal $g$ is for Ada Lovelace to pick up the right fork.
Although it is also possible for Alan Turing to pick up the fork to his left, this step is not a valid hint.
Performing this action will result in deadlock.
