\section{Soundness proofs}
\label{sec:soundnessproofs}

\begin{proof}[Soundness of handle]

  We prove \cref{lem:soundhandle} by induction over $\tilde{t}$.

  \case{$\tilde{t}=\Enter \tau$}
 {One rule applies, namely \userule{SH-Fill}\\
 Since we have $\mathds{C}(t,\sigma,\Enter \tau,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$, we know that $t$ must be $\Enter \tau$ too, $\tilde{t}$ contains no symbols.
 There exists only one symbolic execution, namely $\Enter \tau,\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},s,\True$.
 We need to show that there exists an $i$ such that $s\sim i$ and $\Edit v,\sigma\handle{i}t',\sigma'$.

 Any concrete value $c$ of type $\tau$ will do. Now we have to show that we end up with $\mathds{C}(\Edit c,\sigma,\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi\land\True,M.[s\mapsto c])$, which holds trivially.
 }

  \case{$\tilde{t}=\Edit \tilde{v}$}
  {One rule applies, namely \userule{SH-Change}\\
  Since we have $\mathds{C}(t,\sigma,\Edit \tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$, we know that either $\tilde{v}$ is a concrete value, or $M$ contains a mapping such that $M\tilde{v}$ becomes a concrete value $c$. We know therefore that $t$ must be $\Edit c$.

  There exists only one symbolic execution, namely $\Edit \tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},s,\True$.
  We need to show that there exists an $i$ such that $s\sim i$ and $\Edit c,\sigma\handle{i}t',\sigma'$.

  Any concrete value $c'$ of the same type as $c$ will do. Now we have to show that we end up with $\mathds{C}(\Edit c',\sigma,\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi\land\True,M.[s\mapsto c'])$, which holds trivially.
  }


\case{$\tilde{t}=\Update l$}
{One rule applies, namely \userule{SH-Update}\\

Since we have $\mathds{C}(t,\sigma,\Update l,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$, we know that $t$ must be $\Update l$ too, $\tilde{t}$ contains no symbols.
There exists only one symbolic execution, namely $\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}[l\mapsto s],s,\True$.
We need to show that there exists an $i$ such that $s\sim i$ and $\Update l,\sigma\handle{i}t',\sigma'$.

Any concrete value $c$ of the same type as $l$ will do. Now we have to show that we end up with $\mathds{C}(\Update l,\sigma[l\mapsto c],\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}[l\mapsto s],\Phi\land\True,M.[s\mapsto c])$, which holds trivially.
}


\case{$\tilde{t}=\tilde{t}_1\Next \tilde{e}_2$}
 {
Since we have $\mathds{C}(t,\sigma,\tilde{t}_1\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$, we know that $M \tilde{t}_1\Next \tilde{e}_2=t$, which comes down to $t_1\Next e_2$ for some concrete $t_1$ and $e_2$.

 In this case, two rules apply.\\

 \case{\userule{SH-Next}}

{
In this case, we have two sets of symbolic executions.

For all tuples $(\tilde{t}_1'\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_1',\tilde{i},\phi_1)$, we know by application of the induction hypothesis that
there exits an $i$ such that $\tilde{i}\sim i$, $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ and
$\mathds{C}(t_1',\sigma',\tilde{t}_1',\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1,M.[s\mapsto c])$ where $c\in i$ and $s\in \tilde{i}$.
Therefore we also have $\mathds{C}(t_1'\Next e_2,\sigma_1',\tilde{t}_1'\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_1',\Phi\land\phi_1,M.[s\mapsto c])$.

For all tuples $(\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2',\Continue,\phi_2)$, we first have by \cref{lem:valpres} that
$\mathds{C}(v_1,\sigma,\tilde{v}_1,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$.
Now, before we can apply \cref{lem:soundnorm}, we need to establish that
$\mathds{C}(e_2\ v_1,\sigma,\tilde{e}_2\ \tilde{v}_1,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$ holds.
This means that we have to show that $M \tilde{e}_2\ \tilde{v}_1 = e_2\ v_1$.
Since application of the mapping is distributive, it suffices to show that $M\tilde{v}_1=v_1$, which is given,
and $M\tilde{e}_2=e_2$, which follows from the premise as well.

At this point, by application of \cref{lem:soundnorm}, we obtain that $e_2\ v_1,\sigma\normalise t_2,\sigma_2'$
and $\mathds{C}(t_1,\sigma_2',\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2',\Phi\land\phi_2,M)$
}
%
\case{\userule{SH-PassNext}}
{
For all tuples $(\tilde{t}_1'\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_1',\tilde{i},\phi_1)$, we know by application of the induction hypothesis that
there exits an $i$ such that $\tilde{i}\sim i$, $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ and
$\mathds{C}(t_1',\sigma',\tilde{t}_1',\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1,M.[s\mapsto c])$ where $c\in i$ and $s\in \tilde{i}$.
Therefore we also have $\mathds{C}(t_1'\Next e_2,\sigma_1',\tilde{t}_1'\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_1',\Phi\land\phi_1,M.[s\mapsto c])$.
}

\case{$\tilde{t}=\tilde{t}_1\Then \tilde{e}_2$}
{One rule applies, namely \userule{SH-PassThen}\\
% Provided that $M\phi$, we need to demonstrate that \userule{H-PassThen} with $\hat{\sigma}=M\sigma$ and $j= M i$,
% $M t_1'\Then e_2\equiv \hat{t_1'}\Then e_2$ and $M\sigma'\equiv\hat{\sigma'}$.
%
% By the induction hypothesis we obtain the following.\\
% $\forall M_1 . M_1 \phi_1 \implies t_1,M_1\sigma \xrightarrow[]{M_1 i} \hat{t_1'},\hat{\sigma'}\land M_1 t_1'\equiv\hat{t_1'}\land M_1\sigma' \equiv \hat{\sigma'}$
%
% Since $M$ satisfies $\phi$, we have $t_1,M\sigma \xrightarrow[]{M i} \hat{t_1'},\hat{\sigma'}$ and $M\sigma'\equiv\hat{\sigma'}$,

%
\case{$\tilde{t}=\tilde{e}_1\Xor \tilde{e}_2$}
 {
In this case, three rules apply.\\

\begin{lemma}[$\Value$ preserves consistence]
  \label{lem:valpres}
  For all concrete tasks $t$, concrete states $\sigma$, symbolic tasks $\tilde{t}$, symbolic states $\tilde{\sigma}$, path conditions $\Phi$ and mappings $M=[s_1\mapsto c_1\cdots s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  if $\mathds{C}(t,\sigma,\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$ and $\Value(t,\sigma)=v$ and $\Value(\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma})$,
  then also $\mathds{C}(v,\sigma,\tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi,M)$
