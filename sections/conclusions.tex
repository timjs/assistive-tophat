\label{sec:conclusion}


\subsection{Future work}


- supporting loops?
- developing a full application that allows for user testing
- iTasks support?

When a user requests a next step hint, the current task and state are passed to $\Hints$, together with the selected goal.
The resulting set cannot directly be presented to the user.
Pairs containing a concrete step ($\Continue,\Left,\Right$), can be given as hints without their path condition.
Pairs containing a symbolic input as hint ($s,\First s,$ etc) should be presented with the path condition.
Since the path condition contains all constraints of the symbolic execution, it may contain constraints on symbols other than the next step hint.
These constraints should be removed from the information shown to the user, as they do not include useful information.
