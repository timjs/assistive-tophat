\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%There are many workflow systems
Software that supports people working together is used in most workplaces nowadays.
Its aim is to automate business workflows, in order to simplify processes, to improve service, or to contain cost.
In settings like hospitals, first responders and military operations, these systems could even prevent the loss of lives.

%they are a problem because

Automation and digitalisation of workflows and business processes comes at a cost.
For end users it can be hard to see how an action influences their desired goal.
They are unable to oversee the complete flow of the process and there might be an abundance of data that they cannot oversee.
Does checking this box prevent me or someone else from reaching our goal?
Have I taken all information into consideration before making a decision?


%our approach overcomes this because
To overcome these difficulties, we propose to integrate a next step hint assistive system into the workflow software.
By combining previous research on symbolic execution for Task-Oriented Programming~\cite{Naus2019} and end-user feedback systems for rule based problems~\cite{DBLP:conf/sfp/NausJ16},
we develop a next step hint end-user feedback system for the Task-Oriented Programming language \TOPHAT~\cite{DBLP:conf/ppdp/SteenvoordenNK19}.
Our solution, which we call Assistive \TOPHAT, generates next step hints from existing code, and does not require extra work by the programmer.
To our knowledge, this is the first work employing symbolic execution to automatically generate next-step hints for end users.

%what is the advantage of our system?
Providing next step hints to end users will provide them with a quick insight in to their situation.
It reduces the chance of human error, while still allowing the user to intervene if required.
The speed and quality of decisions will improve, raising the overall performance.
\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes the following contributions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We describe an end user next step feedback system for \TOPHAT.
  \item We prove soundness and completeness of next step hints generated by this system.
  \item We present an implementation of the user feedback system in Haskell.
  \item We prove the symbolic execution semantics of \TOPHAT to be sound and complete.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Structure}

\cref{sec:tophat} first introduces the Task-Oriented Programming (\TOP) paradigm and the Task-Oriented Programming language \TOPHAT.
\cref{sec:examples} lists three example programs to illustrate how \TOPHAT works and to show what we like to achieve with Assistive \TOPHAT.
In \cref{sec:symbolic} we introduce briefly the symbolic execution semantics for \TOPHAT.
\cref{sec:assistive} follows with a description of assistive \TOPHAT
and describes the implementation of the system in Haskell.
In \cref{sec:properties} soundness and completeness of the assistive system are shown.
% An implementation of the system in Haskell is described in \cref{sec:implementation}.
\cref{sec:relatedwork} gives an overview of related work, and finally \cref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
