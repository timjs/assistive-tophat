\subsection{Dining Computer Scientists Problem}

The dining philosophers problem is a classic concurrency problem in computer science.
A number of philosophers sit at a round table with a meal in front of them.
In between the plates lies one fork.
In order to eat their meal, each philosopher has to acquire two forks.
This, of course, means that all philosophers cannot eat at the same time, since there are not enough forks.
Deadlock can occur when all philosophers pick up the fork to their right (or left).
Then, everybody has one fork.
Therefore, each philosopher cannot start his meal, and is also not allowed to put his fork back on the table.

\end{TASK}

We look at dining computer scientists instead.
\cref{lst:dining} lists an implementation in \TOPHAT for this problem, with three computer scientists.
The forks are represented by references containing Booleans (\cref{lst:phil:fork0,lst:phil:fork1,lst:phil:fork2}).
The value $\True$ indicates that the fork is available,
$\False$ indicates that the fork is being used.

Picking up a fork is only possible when the fork is available,
i.e the reading the reference results is $\True$ (\cref{lst:phil:this}).
This fork is then marked as being used (\cref{lst:phil:mark-used}).
The use of references ensures that the neighbouring scientist cannot pick up this fork: this choice will be disabled.
After that, one can press continue if the second fork is also available (\cref{lst:phil:that}).
For the sake of simplicity, one returns the first fork, rather than setting the second fork to $\False$, and then setting both to $\True$ again.

Each computer scientist takes as arguments a name and references to the two forks that he or she can reach (\cref{lst:phil:scientist}).
They have a choice to take either the left or the right fork.
This is represented with an user choice ($\Xor$, \cref{lst:phil:pick}).
The last lines instantiate three computer scientists sitting next to each other (\cref{lst:phil:scientist0,lst:phil:scientist1,lst:phil:scientist2}).
In \TOP terms, this means they collaborate in parallel ($\And$) while eating their dinner while sharing some resources,
in this cease $\lbl{fork0}$, $\lbl{fork1}$, and $\lbl{fork2}$.

Note that the events of picking up a fork are performed sequentially.
That is, when one computer scientist decides to pick up his right fork, we will handle that event first.
After that, we will handle the choices from the other scientists.
So, the order of the events is explicitly determined by the scientists themselves.
% This is regardless of choices interfering or not.

\todo{Write analysis.}
In \cref{sec:todo} we will analyse this example.
Our goal is to hint each scientist which choice to make, in order to reach the common goal of full bellies.
When the scientists follow these hints, no deadlock will occur.


\subsection{Tax subsidy request}

The example program listed in this section is taken from our previous work on symbolic execution for \TOPHAT~\cite{Steenvoorden2019}.
It models a simplified tax subsidy application process for citizens who have installed solar panels.
This was first described by Stutterheim~et~al.\cite{conf/sfp/StutterheimAP17},
who worked on modelling a fictional but realistic law about solar panel subsidies.

A subsidy is only given under the following conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item The roofing company has confirmed that they installed solar panels for the citizen.
\item The tax officer has approved the request.
\item The tax officer can only approve the request if the roofing company has confirmed, and the request is filed within one year of the invoice date.
\item The amount of the granted subsidy is maximal â‚¬600.
\end{itemize}

\lstset{emph={invoiceDate,today,confirmed,invoiceAmount,approved}}
\begin{TASK}[
    float=ht,
    numbers=right,
    caption={Subsidy request and approval workflow at the Dutch tax office.},
    label=lst:tax]
  let provideDocuments = enter Amount <&> enter Date in
  let companyConfirm = edit True <?> edit False in
  let officerApprove = \ invoiceDate. \ today. \ confirmed.
    edit False <?> if (today - invoiceDate < 365 /\ confirmed) $\label{lst:tax:officer-approve-def}$ then edit True else fail in
  update currentDate >>= \ today.$\label{lst:tax:citizen-info}$
  provideDocuments <&> companyConfirm >>= \ <<<<invoiceAmount, invoiceDate>>, confirmed>>. $\label{lst:tax:documents-and-company-confirm}$
  officerApprove invoiceDate today confirmed >>= \ approved.$\label{lst:tax:officer-approve}$
  let subsidyAmount = if approved then min 600 (invoiceAmount / 10) else 0 in
  edit <<subsidyAmount, approved, confirmed, invoiceDate, today>>$\label{lst:tax:result}$
\end{TASK}

\Cref{lst:tax} gives the \TOPHAT code for this example.
\todo{Explain code in example of leave it out?}
%
In previous work, we have shown that this code indeed adheres to the requirements listed above.
There we focussed on assisting the developer by proving the program correct.
In this work we focus on supporting the end user that is requesting a subsidy.
The end user wants the outcome of this program to be a subsidy amount larger than zero.
In \cref{sec:todo} we will show how to generate hints for the end user to reach this goal.
