\label{sec:completenessproofs}

\begin{proof}[Completeness of simulate]
  The structure of this proof is outlined in \cref{fig:proofstructure}.

  We have $t$ and $\sigma$ such that $t,\sigma\interact{I}^*v$.
  By definition of $\interact{I}^*$, we have the following.

  $t,\sigma\interact{i_1}t_1,\sigma_1\interact{i_2}\cdots \interact{i_n}t_n,\sigma_n$ with $\Value(t_n,\sigma_n)$ and $I=[i_1,\cdots,i_n]$.

  We need to show that we have $(\tilde{v},\tilde{I},\Phi)\in t,\sigma\interact{}^*)$,
  which is defined as follows.

  \begin{align*}
      t,\sigma\interact{}&\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\simi_1,\phi_1&\\
                      &\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}_1\interact{}&\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2,\simi_2,\phi_2\\
                      &                                    &\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2\interact{}&\cdots&\\
                      &                                    &                                    &\cdots&
                      \interact{}\tilde{t}_n,\tilde{\sigma}_n,\simi_n,\phi_n
  \end{align*}

  with $\Value(\tilde{t}_n,\tilde{\sigma}_n)=\tilde{v}$ and $\Sat(\phi_1\land\cdots\land\phi_n)$.

  By \cref{lem:completeinteracting}, we know that $t,\sigma\interact{}\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\simi_1,\phi_1$ exists,
  since $t,\sigma,t\Consistent_{\emptyset}\sigma,\True$.
  This also gives us that $\simi_1\sim i_1$ and $t_1,\sigma_1\Consistent_{[s_1\mapsto c_1]}\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}_1,\phi_1$ with $\SymOf(\simi_1)=s_1$ and $\ValOf(i_1)=c_1$.

  By repeated application of \cref{lem:completeinteracting}, untill we arrive at $t_n,\sigma_n$,
  we can show that there exists a $\tilde{I}$ such that $t,\sigma\interact{}^*\tilde{t}_n,\tilde{\sigma}_n,\tilde{I},\Phi$,
  namely $[\simi_1,\cdots,\simi_n]$.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness of handling]
  \label{lem:completeHandle}
  For all concrete tasks $t$, concrete states $\sigma$, concrete inputs $i$, symbolic tasks $\tilde{t}$, symbolic states $\tilde{\sigma}$ path conditions $\Phi$ and mappings $M$,
  we have that $t,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and
  $t,\sigma\handle{i}t',\sigma'$ together with
  $\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}\simhandle\overline{\tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}',\simi,\phi}$,
  and for all pairs $(\tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}',\simi,\phi)$ we have that $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi)$ and $\imath\sim i$ implies $t',\sigma'\Consistent_{M.[s\mapsto c]}\tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$ where where $\SymOf(\simi)=s$ and $\ValOf(i)=c$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness of normalisation]
  \label{lem:completeNormalise}
  For all concrete expressions $e$, concrete states $\sigma$, symbolic expressions $\tilde{e}$, symbolic states $\tilde{\sigma}$ path conditions $\Phi$ and mappings $M$,
  we have that $e,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$
  and $e,\sigma\normalise t,\sigma'$,
  then $\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma}\simnormalise\overline{\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi}$,
  and for all pairs $(\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi)$ we have that $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi)$ implies $t,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness of striding]
  \label{lem:completeStride}
  For all concrete tasks $t$, concrete states $\sigma$, symbolic tasks $\tilde{t}$, symbolic states $\tilde{\sigma}$ path conditions $\Phi$ and mappings $M$,
  we have that $t,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$
  and $t,\sigma\stride t',\sigma'$,
  then $\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}\simstride\overline{\tilde{t'},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi}$,
  and for all pairs $(\tilde{t'},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi)$ we have that $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi)$ implies $t',\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t'},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness of evaluate]
  \label{lem:completeEval}
  For all concrete expressions $e$, concrete states $\sigma$, symbolic expressions $\tilde{e}$, symbolic states $\tilde{\sigma}$ path conditions $\Phi$ and mappings $M$,
  we have that $e,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$
  and $e,\sigma\eval v,\sigma'$,
  then $\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma}\simeval\overline{\tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi}$,
  and for all pairs $(\tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma}',\phi)$ we have that $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi)$ implies $v,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Completeness of handle]
  We prove Lemma~\ref{lem:completeHandle} by induction over $t$.\\

    \Case{$t=\Edit v$}
    {
    Provided that $\Edit v,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-Change},
    then $\Edit\tilde{v},\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},s,\True$.
    $\Sat(\Phi\land\True)=\Sat(\Phi)$, which follows from the premise.
    Furthermore we have $s\sim v'$ by definition.
    Then finally $\Edit v',\sigma\Consistent{M[s\mapsto v']}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ since $M[s\mapsto v'] s = v'$.


    }

    \Case{$t=\Enter \tau$}
    {
    Provided that $\Enter \tau,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-Fill}
    then $\Enter\tau,\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},s,\True$.
    $\Sat(\Phi\land\True)=\Sat(\Phi)$, which follows from the premise.
    Furthermore we have $s\sim v$ by definition.
    Then finally $\Edit v,\sigma\Consistent{M[s\mapsto v]}\Edit s,\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ since $M[s\mapsto v] s = v$.
    }

    \Case{$t=\Update l$}
    {
    Provided that $\Update l,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-Update},
    then $\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}\handle{}\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}[l\mapsto s],s,\True$.
    $\Sat(\Phi\land\True)=\Sat(\Phi)$, which follows from the premise.
    Furthermore we have $s\sim v$ by definition.
    Then finally $\Update l,\sigma[l\mapsto v]\Consistent{M[s\mapsto v]}\Update l,\tilde{\sigma}[l\mapsto s],\Phi$ since $M[s\mapsto v] s = v$.
     }

    \Case{$t=t_1\Next e_2$}
    {\Case{$i=\Continue$}
      {
      Provided that $t_1\Next e_2,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-Next},
      then \Userule{SH-Next}.
      The simulation step results in two sets, from which only the second adheres to the requirement that the symbolic input should simulate the concrete input.
      For this set, $\overline{\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2',\Continue,\phi_2}$, we have $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi_2)$ implies
      $t_2,\sigma_2'\Consistent_M\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}_2',\Phi\land\phi_2$,
      Which follows directly from \cref{lem:completeNormalise}.
      }
      \Case{$i\neq\Continue$}
      {
      Provided that $t_1\Next e_2,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-PassNext}.\\
      There are three symbolic rules that apply, namely\\
      \Userule{SH-PassNext},\\
      \Userule{SH-PassNextFail} and\\
      \Userule{SH-Next}.

      We are only interested in the runs that produce a symbolic input that simulates the concrete input $i$.
      Whichever rule applies, we deal with the same premise because of this restriction.
      This allows us to apply the induction hypothesis and obtain that
      $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi_1)\implies t_1',\sigma'\Consistent_{M.[s\mapsto c]}\tilde{t}_1',\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1$.
      From this, we can directly conclude that $t_1'\Next e_2,\sigma'\Consistent_{M.[s\mapsto c]}\tilde{t}_1'\Next \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1$.
      }
    }


    \Case{$t=t_1\Then e_2$}
    {
    Provided that $t_1\Then e_2,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-PassThen},\\
    then \Userule{SH-PassThen}.

    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi)$ implies $t_1',\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t}_1',\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$
    from which we can conclude that $t_1'\Then e_2,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t}_1'\Then \tilde{e}_2,\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.

      Provided that $e_1\Xor e_2,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-PickLeft},\\
      then \Userule{SH-Pick}.

      By \cref{lem:completeNormalise} we obtain $\Sat(\Phi\land\phi_1)$ implies $t_1,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1$
      from which we can conclude that $t_1,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t}_1,\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_1$.

      Provided that $e_1\Xor e_2,\sigma\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$ and \Userule{H-PickLeft},\\
      then \Userule{SH-Pick}.

      from which we can conclude that $t_2,\sigma'\Consistent_{M}\tilde{t}_2,\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi_2$.

      }
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Completeness of normalise]
  We prove Lemma~\ref{lem:completeNormalise} by induction over $e$.

  From the premise, we can assume that $e,\sigma\Consistent_M\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma},\Phi$.
  Now, given that $e,\sigma\normalise t,\sigma'$,
  we need to demonstrate that $\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma}\normalise \tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}'$ with $t,\sigma'\Consistent_M\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.

  The base case is when the N-Done rule applies.\\
  \Userule{N-Done}\\

  In this case, we obtain from \cref{lem:completeEval} that
  $\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma}\simnormalise \tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}'$ with $t,\sigma'\Consistent_M\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$,
  which is exactly what we needed to show.

  The only induction step is when\\
  \Userule{N-Repeat} applies.

  In this case, we obtain from \cref{lem:completeEval} that
  $\tilde{e},\tilde{\sigma}\simnormalise \tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}'$ with $t,\sigma'\Consistent_M\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}',\Phi\land\phi$.
  Furthermore, by \cref{lem:completeStride} we obtain that
  $\tilde{t},\tilde{\sigma}'\simstride \tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}''$ with $t',\sigma''\Consistent_M\tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}'',\Phi\land\phi_1\land\phi_2$.
  Then finally, by application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain what we needed to prove.
  $\tilde{t}',\tilde{\sigma}''\simnormalise \tilde{t}'',\tilde{\sigma}'''$ with $t'',\sigma'''\Consistent_M\tilde{t}'',\tilde{\sigma}''',\Phi\land\phi_1\land\phi_2\land\phi_3$.
